Books Explorer is a web application that allows users to explore and browse books via the Open Library Subjects API. The application features dynamic filtering by subject/category, client-side pagination, and a modal for displaying detailed information about each book. With a modern, responsive design built with Bootstrap 5 and custom CSS, Book Explorer ensures that the footer always stays at the bottom, even on pages with little content.
